# Control of a Quadrotor in 3D #

## The Tasks ##

### Body rate and roll/pitch control (scenario 2) ###

The functions `GenerateMotorCommands()`, `BodyRateControl()`, and
 `RollPitchControl()` were implemented successfully.

The major difficulty stemmed from the fact that the project or code
does not apparently describe what are the rotation direction of each
rotor. I needed to figure out this through experiments with the
simulator, which took me to realize that I need to change one sign in
the equation for the moment about Z relative to the equations provided
in the theoretical part.

### Position/velocity and yaw angle control (scenario 3) ###

Next, you will implement the position, altitude and yaw control for your quad.  For the simulation, you will use `Scenario 3`.  This will create 2 identical quads, one offset from its target point (but initialized with yaw = 0) and second offset from target point but yaw = 45 degrees.

 - implement the code in the function `LateralPositionControl()`
 - implement the code in the function `AltitudeControl()`
 - tune parameters `kpPosZ` and `kpPosZ`
 - tune parameters `kpVelXY` and `kpVelZ`

If successful, the quads should be going to their destination points and tracking error should be going down (as shown below). However, one quad remains rotated in yaw.

 - implement the code in the function `YawControl()`
 - tune parameters `kpYaw` and the 3rd (z) component of `kpPQR`

Tune position control for settling time. Donâ€™t try to tune yaw control too tightly, as yaw control requires a lot of control authority from a quadcopter and can really affect other degrees of freedom.  This is why you often see quadcopters with tilted motors, better yaw authority!

**Hint:**  For a second order system, such as the one for this quadcopter, the velocity gain (`kpVelXY` and `kpVelZ`) should be at least ~3-4 times greater than the respective position gain (`kpPosXY` and `kpPosZ`).

### Non-idealities and robustness (scenario 4) ###

In this part, we will explore some of the non-idealities and robustness of a controller.  For this simulation, we will use `Scenario 4`.  This is a configuration with 3 quads that are all are trying to move one meter forward.  However, this time, these quads are all a bit different:
 - The green quad has its center of mass shifted back
 - The orange vehicle is an ideal quad
 - The red vehicle is heavier than usual

1. Run your controller & parameter set from Step 3.  Do all the quads seem to be moving OK?  If not, try to tweak the controller parameters to work for all 3 (tip: relax the controller).

2. Edit `AltitudeControl()` to add basic integral control to help with the different-mass vehicle.

3. Tune the integral control, and other control parameters until all the quads successfully move properly.  Your drones' motion should look like this:

### Tracking trajectories ###

Now that we have all the working parts of a controller, you will put it all together and test it's performance once again on a trajectory.  For this simulation, you will use `Scenario 5`.  This scenario has two quadcopters:
 - the orange one is following `traj/FigureEight.txt`
 - the other one is following `traj/FigureEightFF.txt` - for now this is the same trajectory.  For those interested in seeing how you might be able to improve the performance of your drone by adjusting how the trajectory is defined, check out **Extra Challenge 1** below!

How well is your drone able to follow the trajectory?  It is able to hold to the path fairly well?


### Extra Challenge 1 (Optional) ###

You will notice that initially these two trajectories are the same. Let's work on improving some performance of the trajectory itself.

1. Inspect the python script `traj/MakePeriodicTrajectory.py`.  Can you figure out a way to generate a trajectory that has velocity (not just position) information?

2. Generate a new `FigureEightFF.txt` that has velocity terms
Did the velocity-specified trajectory make a difference? Why?

With the two different trajectories, your drones' motions should look like this:

### Extra Challenge 2 (Optional) ###

For flying a trajectory, is there a way to provide even more information for even better tracking?

How about trying to fly this trajectory as quickly as possible (but within following threshold)!


## Evaluation ##

To assist with tuning of your controller, the simulator contains real time performance evaluation.  We have defined a set of performance metrics for each of the scenarios that your controllers must meet for a successful submission.

There are two ways to view the output of the evaluation:

 - in the command line, at the end of each simulation loop, a **PASS** or a **FAIL** for each metric being evaluated in that simulation
 - on the plots, once your quad meets the metrics, you will see a green box appear on the plot notifying you of a **PASS**


### Performance Metrics ###

The specific performance metrics are as follows:

 - scenario 2
   - roll should less than 0.025 radian of nominal for 0.75 seconds (3/4 of the duration of the loop)
   - roll rate should less than 2.5 radian/sec for 0.75 seconds

 - scenario 3
   - X position of both drones should be within 0.1 meters of the target for at least 1.25 seconds
   - Quad2 yaw should be within 0.1 of the target for at least 1 second


 - scenario 4
   - position error for all 3 quads should be less than 0.1 meters for at least 1.5 seconds

 - scenario 5
   - position error of the quad should be less than 0.25 meters for at least 3 seconds
